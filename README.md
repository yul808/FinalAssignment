# HAUNTED HOUSE
This repository serves as the Final Assignment for the Tech Basics 1 Course.

The small game of this repository is meant to show some of the techniques we have learned in this course. 

Note:
The difficulty of the game lies not within the completion of the game. Instead it is meant to be completed as fast as possible. The free character movement allows the player to find new, more efficient ways to win the game.

The current developer record is 16.658 seconds. Can you beat it?
